# Loyola Bitcoin Notary Project

This is an under-development project by students of the [Technology and Legal 
Innovation Clinic](https://loyolalawtech.org) at [Loyola College of Law, New 
Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).  It uses [Manuel Araoz's](https://maraoz.com/) 
[Proof of Existence API](https://proofofexistence.com/developers) and relies 
heavily on his wonderful work and ideas.

An in-progress demo of what we are working on can be found 
[here](http://loyolalawtech.github.io/Bitcoin-Notary/index.html).
